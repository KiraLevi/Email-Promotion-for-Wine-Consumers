# Email-Promotion-for-Wine-Consumers
Evaluate whether the promotion is effective and who to target with the email campaign.

Main task is to analyze the data and provide:

a) An evaluation of the average causal effect to be inserted in the main presentation.

b) Slice and dice analysis to illustrate the potential for targeting on responses for this email campaign. You should identify a good example of how slicing and dicing the data can lead to significant and economically meaningful differences in causal effects.

c) “Individual-level” conditional causal effect estimates to be used along with the margin and cost information to score each customer. Use the best approach to scoring available. Make predictions for the training sample.
